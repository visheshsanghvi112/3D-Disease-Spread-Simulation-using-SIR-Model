# 3D Disease Spread Simulation using SIR Model  

This project is a **Streamlit-based interactive simulation** of disease spread using the **SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model**. It visualizes how infections propagate within a network of individuals based on **real-world contact data**.  

## **Features**  
âœ… **User-adjustable Parameters:** Control infection probability, recovery probability, and recovery time.  
âœ… **CSV Input Support:** Upload a dataset with person-to-person contact data.  
âœ… **SIR Model Simulation:** Tracks disease progression over time.  
âœ… **3D Visualization:** Interactive Plotly-based 3D network graph of infection spread.  
âœ… **Time-Series Analysis:** Line plot showing SIR population dynamics.  

## **How It Works**  
1. **Upload a CSV file** containing columns:  
   - `Person_ID` (Unique ID of the individual)  
   - `Contact_ID` (Person they were in contact with)  
   - `Infection_Status` (Susceptible, Infected, or Recovered)  
   - `Days_Infected` (Days since infection)  

2. **Graph Creation:** A network is built where nodes represent individuals and edges represent contacts.  
3. **Disease Spread Simulation:** The infection propagates based on the **SIR model**, updating status dynamically.  
4. **Visualize Results:**  
   - A **time-series plot** shows how Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered populations evolve.  
   - **3D Network Graphs** depict the disease spread in real-time.
