3D Disease Spread Simulation using SIR Model

This project is a Streamlit-based interactive simulation of disease spread using the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. It visualizes how infections propagate within a network of individuals based on real-world contact data.

Features

âœ… User-adjustable Parameters: Control infection probability, recovery probability, and recovery time.âœ… CSV Input Support: Upload a dataset with person-to-person contact data.âœ… SIR Model Simulation: Tracks disease progression over time.âœ… 3D Visualization: Interactive Plotly-based 3D network graph of infection spread.âœ… Time-Series Analysis: Line plot showing SIR population dynamics.

How It Works

Upload a CSV file containing columns: Person_ID, Contact_ID, Infection_Status, and Days_Infected.

Graph Creation: A network is built where nodes represent individuals and edges represent contacts.

Disease Spread Simulation: The infection propagates based on the SIR model, updating status dynamically.

Visualize Results:

A time-series plot shows how Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered populations evolve.

3D Network Graphs depict the disease spread in real-time.
